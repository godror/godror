# ODPI-C

Oracle Database Programming Interface for C (ODPI-C) is an open source library
of C code that simplifies access to Oracle Database for applications written in
C or C++.  It is a wrapper over [Oracle Call Interface
(OCI)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/oci/index.html) that
makes applications and language interfaces easier to develop.

ODPI-C supports basic and advanced features of Oracle Database and
Oracle Client.  See the [homepage](https://oracle.github.io/odpi/) for
a list.
