Graph Studio
------------
Oracle Graph Studio lets you create scalable property graph databases. Graph Studio automates the creation of graph models and in-memory graphs from database tables. It includes notebooks and developer APIs that allow you to execute graph queries using PGQL (an SQL-like graph query language) and over 50 built-in graph algorithms. Graph Studio also offers dozens of visualization, including native graph visualization.

Oracle Machine Learning User Interface
--------------------------------------
The Oracle Machine Learning User Interface provides immediate access to the Oracle Machine Learning components and functionality on Autonomous Database, including OML Notebooks, OML AutoML UI, OML Models, and template example notebooks. Through OML Notebooks, users can develop notebooks comprised of SQL, PL/SQL, R, Python, and markdown paragraphs and use OML4SQL, OML4R, and OML4Py APIs.These APIs provide access to over 30 parallelized, scalable in-database machine learningalgorithms, supporting classification, regression, anomaly detection, clustering, associations, attribute importance, feature extraction, and times series forecasting, among others. Through OML4Py and OML4R, users can invoke user-defined Python and R functions in engines spawned and controlled by the database environment, with optional data-parallel and task-parallel invocation, as well as deploy those user-defined functions from SQL and REST APIs.
